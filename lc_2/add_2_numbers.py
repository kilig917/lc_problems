# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

# Example:
# Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
# Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
